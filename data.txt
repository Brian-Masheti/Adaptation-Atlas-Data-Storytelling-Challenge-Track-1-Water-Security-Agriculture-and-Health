About

To participate in this challenge, you will need to draw on a variety of datasets to answer key questions for each track. You can find the key questions in the Track 1 key questions, technical information and resources document. In the same document, we have suggested some datasets that may be useful in answering each question. Do not restrict yourself to these datasets, or feel obliged to use all of them. You should use any publicly available data to answer these questions.

Here are some additional resources you will find useful:
